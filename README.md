# hacknroll2021-project

This project uses a **microcontroller with DAC** to **plot on the X and Y axis** of an oscilloscope. By controlling the X and Y coordinates, an **image can be drawn on the screen**. For this hackathon, I draw the animated H&R 2021 logo. A PC program is in charge of sending the sends the different frames of the logo.
